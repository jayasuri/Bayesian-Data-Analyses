We will look at the `sleepstudy` data frame. You can learn more about it with `?sleepstudy`, but the basics are that 18 subjects were allowed only 3 hours of sleep a night. Their reaction times were measured each day for 10 days.

First a summary of the data frame, then a quick look at all of the data at once, followed by separate plots for each subject.

```{r first look}
summary(sleepstudy)

sleepstudy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Days, y = Reaction)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

sleepstudy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Days, y = Reaction)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  facet_wrap(~ Subject)

```

```{r non-hierarchical}

sleep1 <- stan_glm(  Days ~ Reaction    ,  data = sleepstudy)
  
```  

```{r pp sleep1}
pp_check(sleep1)

```

It fits okay, but clearly there are some issues.

```{r hierarchical}

sleep2 <- stan_glmer(   Days ~ Reaction | Subject   ,  data = sleepstudy)

```

```{r interactive check}
# launch_shinystan(sleep2) 
```

```{r plots sleep2}
pp_check(sleep2)

plot(sleep2, plotfun = "areas", pars = "Days", prob = 0.9)
plot(sleep2, plotfun = "areas", pars = "(Intercept)", prob = 0.9)
plot(sleep2, plotfun = "areas", pars = "sigma", prob = 0.9)



plot(sleep2, plotfun = "pairs", pars = c("Days", "(Intercept)", "sigma"))


posterior_vs_prior(sleep2, pars = c("Days", "sigma"))


```

```{r summary}
summary(sleep2)
```

```{r credible interval}
hdi(sleep2, ci = .9)
```
